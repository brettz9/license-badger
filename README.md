Adopts helpful categories of [npm-consider](https://github.com/delfrrr/npm-consider):
"publicDomain", "permissive", "weaklyProtective", "protective", "networkProtective",
and "uncategorized". We also add "reuseProtective" (for
[RPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocal_Public_License) and
[Parity](https://licensezero.com/licenses/parity) type licenses which put
conditions on even private use) and "unlicensed" (which is copyrighted or
otherwise explicitly against reuse--rather than merely being currently
unspecified).
